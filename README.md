#Cookie-Stand
##User Stories
-As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
-As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
-As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand

##Technical Requirements
-New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
-Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
-Good use of Object Literals (no constructors allowed today); one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names.
-Main page meets requirements of the problem domain
-Stores are correctly rendering as lists to the main page
